Note that all this options and settings are also available in the global header. It is one big double menu entry by design. You as the user can decide with what to work. The Topbar tool area can be hidden.



Globals section
---------------

The Globals section contains everything that is not related to the currently selected object. But global. Rendersettings, View-, Scene- and Worldsettings.



Object Data Section
-------------------

The Object Data section contains everything that is related to the currently selected object. From mesh data across material up to texture and particle system.

The content differs, dependant of the currently active object. For an Armature you will have other tabs than for a Mesh object, and other tabs for a Lattice object for example.

There are some general tabs though for all object types. Like Object, Constraints, Texture, or Physics tab.
