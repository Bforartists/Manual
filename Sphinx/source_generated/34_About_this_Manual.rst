About this Manual
=================

Bforartists is a Blender fork. And so also the Bforartists Manual is based at the Blender manual. So it can still happen that parts of the Blender manual can be found in the Bforartists manual.

However, the Bforartists 2 manual is a complete rewrite, and so the number of parts from the Blender manual in the Bforartists manual should go against zero. It describes of course the same tools.




Manipulating Bforartists Manual
===============================

The Bforartists Manual is a community driven effort to which anyone can contribute. 

And this very easy, since the manual comes not only as pdf files, but also as editable \*.odt files. That's the file format for Libre and Open Office. Both free and open source Office solutions. To manipulate or to fix a typoe, a word, a sentence or even a whole chapter is as easy as manipulating the text in Libre Office or Open Office, commit the changes to the manual repository, and tell the Bforartists developers to put it online.

The repository with the ODT files can be found here: https://github.com/Bforartists/Manual




License
=======

The Bforartists’s Manual is free and published under Public Domain\*

This means that anyone is free to download, edit and share the manual. It also means that when contributing to the manual you don’t hold exclusive copyright to your text. You are, of course, acknowledged and appreciated for your contribution. However others can change and improve your text in order to keep the manual consistent and up to date.

\* As of writing this part here the Blender manual for 2.77 and below was put under a Public Domain AS CC0 license. Which is simply invalid. You can have either Public domain. Or CC0. Those two licenses contradicts each other.

It also seems that the Blender manual was put under CC0 without asking all involved persons if they wanted to do so. The original manual was under OCL licenese. Another license breach.

So i choose the license type that seems to fit most here, especially when looking at the old licensing. Public Domain. The old Blender parts are still under OCL license.

The Bforartists 2 manual should not contain any old Blender manual material anymore once it is finished, and is then fully under Public Domain.
