If you want a symmetrical haircut, first select all particles, then mirror the particles, then tick X Mirror in the Particle panel.



Remove Doubles
--------------

Remove double vertices that are very close to each other. This can for example happen when you mirror the particles.



Unify Length
------------

Unifies the length of the selected hair particles. The length is calculated by the average length of the selection.



Rekey
-----

You need to have some hair particles selected.

Rekey changes the number of keys for the selected particles, including root and tip keys. This tool brings up a popup where you can adjust the number of keys. Two means you have only a root and a tip key. Everything more subdivides the selected hair particle with more keys.
