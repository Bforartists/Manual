Bforartists 2 History
=====================



Preface: 
---------

It was for a while not clear if and how we continue with the Bforartists 2 development. The Blender developers did quite a few things right with 2.80. Icon buttons in the tool shelf, streamlined UI and so on. In best case Blender 2.80 would have made a Bforartists 2 obsolete.

But they did also quite a few things wrong again. The hard to read monochrome icons and still a hard to read standard theme, the new tool shelf, wich is one gigantic hacky solution that doubles the tool set, under the hood still a big mess full of double menu entries, and so on. But alone the toolbar from Bforartist 1 justified the further development already. It is so useful. And so the decision was made to continue with development.

There was no exact date when the development started again. There was quite a few things still to do for Bforartists 1, which was at the same time preparation work for Bforartists 2 already. Manual for example. And the merge of Blender 2.80 code into the Bforartists master was also a longer process across several days. The official starting point was the release of the Bforartists 2 Manifest, which defines the will and the further development goals.

Bforartists 1 History
=====================



Preface:
--------

Welcome to Bforartists, the free and open source 3D modeling, rendering and animation suite.

Bforartists is a fork of the popluar open source 3d software Blender. And, similar to Blender, of course also open source and under the GPL license. The primary goal of the Bforartists fork is to deliver a better graphical UI and a better usability. This means a complete switch in the useage philosophy. Away from the hotkey and speed centered useage. Away from crazy decisions like RMB select. Towards a user friendly and intuitive graphical UI that can be used with a mouse and one hand when neccessary. And that is much closer to the common UI standards of many other software.

The idea to solve the UI dilemma of Blender and to fork it was long around since years. It was no easy decision to really start it. Blender is a code monster. And so the answer to the question shall i really start a fork was always no. But at one point it was simply enough how the user interface gots treaten by the Blender developers. The answer if Blender should be forked turned from \*no\* to \*possible with some big caveats\*. And then the decision was made to fork Blender.

The Bforartists project itself started officially at July the 2nd 2015. That's when the first real steps were done. 



History:
--------

2.6.2015 - Decision day. The first pages for the UI proposal were written. The work at the homepage started. Which was the official start of the whole project.

2.7.2015 - The domain bforartists was registered.

13.8.2015 - The Bforartists page was finished and went live.

22.8.2015 - Github account was created and went live.

21.9.2015 - The first Bforartists version 0.1 was released. It was based at Blender 2.75. And containted not this much more than the changed branding.

14.10.2015 - Version 0.2brought the changes for Blender 2.76. And that was the moment when Bforartists started to walk alone.

19.12.2015 - Version 0.2.1 introduced a new keymap and a new navigation scheme. And already quite a few changes at the UI layout. Blender has a ton of missing UI entries and a ton of double and even triple menu entries. It also brought in the Blender 2.76 a and b patches to Bforartists

27.01.2016 - Bforartists 0.2.2was mainly around a plugin to display the most needed hotkeys up left.

18.03.2016 - Bforartists 0.3.0 introduced the first incarnation of icon buttons in the tool shelf.

26.03.2016 - Bforartists 0.3.1 came with some small fixes that were overlooked for version 0.3.0. The splash screen was changed because of ongoing trolling.

02.08.2016 - Bforartists 0.4.0 was a small refinement release that was the final stroke below the try to implement Qt and new editor types. Which did simply not work.

04.09.2016 - Bforartists 0.4.1brought mainly changes to the tooltips. Nearly every tooltip contains the tool name now too. 

16.09.2016 - 0.4.2 is another small release mainly around catching some more tooltips and small quirks. New is the Materials Library FX addon, which is also natively included into Blender 2.78 now.

24.09.2016 - 0.5.0 is a milestone release. It marks the end of the first big development cycle. The tracker is empty for the first time since development start.

02.11.2016 - 0.6.0 brings fixes to the addons, first subtabs in the panels, and the Mini lightlib addon.

01.12.2016 - 0.7.0 was mainly cleanup work in the Properties editor. 

08.01.2017 - Version 0.8.0 brings the new Toolbar editor. 

27.02.2017 - Version 0.9.0 is the merge of the actual Blender version 2.78 C into Bforartists.

13.03.2017 - Version 0.9.1 is a bug fix release that fixes some show stoppers from version 0.9.0. 

10.4.2017 - Version 0.9.2 is around cleaning up the menus and connecting some loose ends. And it introduces a Mac build.

13.9.2017 - Version 0.9.3 is the merge of Blender 2.79 into Bforartists. Plus a few smaller adjustments and fixes.

14.9.2017 - An emergency release because of a showstopper bug. The bake panels were missing.

02.03.2018 - Version 0.9.6 brings the changes from Blender 2.79a, and adds 260 changes from Bforartists side.

19.04.2018 - Version 0.9.7 brings the full keymap, the changes from Blender 2.79b, and lots of small improvements and fixes. More compact brush panels for example.

04.05.2018 - Version 1.0.0 RC1 marks the end of this development cycle. All initial development goals that could be fulfilled are fulfilled.

11.05.2018 - Version 1.0.0 is live.




Blender’s History
=================

In 1988 Ton Roosendaal co-founded the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo. NeoGeo quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands and one of the leading animation houses in Europe. NeoGeo created award-winning productions (European Corporate Video Awards 1993 and 1995) for large corporate clients such as multi-national electronics company Philips. Within NeoGeo Ton was responsible for both art direction and internal software development. After careful deliberation Ton decided that the current in-house 3D toolset for NeoGeo was too old and cumbersome to maintain, and needed to be rewritten from scratch. In 1995 this rewrite began and was destined to become the 3D software creation we all know as Blender. As NeoGeo continued to refine and improve Blender it became apparent to Ton that Blender could be used as a tool for other artists outside of NeoGeo.

In 1998, Ton decided to found a new company called Not a Number (NaN) as a spin-off of NeoGeo to further market and develop Blender. At the core of NaN was a desire to create and distribute a compact, cross platform 3D application for free. At the time this was a revolutionary concept as most commercial 3D applications cost thousands of dollars. NaN hoped to bring professional level 3D modeling and animation tools within the reach of the general computing public. NaN’s business model involved providing commercial products and services around Blender. In 1999 NaN attended its first SIGGRAPH conference in an effort to more widely promote Blender. Blender’s first SIGGRAPH convention was a huge success and gathered a tremendous amount of interest from both the press and attendees. Blender was a hit and its huge potential confirmed!

Following the success of the SIGGRAPH conference in early 2000, NaN secured financing of €4.5M from venture capitalists. This large inflow of cash enabled NaN to rapidly expand its operations. Soon NaN boasted as many as fifty employees working around the world trying to improve and promote Blender. In the summer of 2000, Blender 2.0 was released. This version of Blender added the integration of a game engine to the 3D application. By the end of 2000, the number of users registered on the NaN website surpassed 250,000.

Unfortunately, NaN’s ambitions and opportunities didn’t match the company’s capabilities and the market realities of the time. This over-extension resulted in restarting NaN with new investor funding and a smaller company in April 2001. Six months later NaN’s first commercial software product, Blender Publisher was launched. This product was targeted at the emerging market of interactive web-based 3D media. Due to disappointing sales and the ongoing difficult economic climate, the new investors decided to shut down all NaN operations. The shutdown also included discontinuing the development of Blender. Although there were clearly shortcomings in the then current version of Blender, such as a complex internal software architecture, unfinished features and a non-standard way of providing the GUI, the enthusiastic support from the user community and customers who had purchased Blender Publisher in the past meant that Ton couldn’t justify leaving Blender to fade into insignificance. Since restarting a company with a sufficiently large team of developers wasn’t feasible, Ton Roosendaal founded the non-profit organization Blender Foundation in March 2002.

The Blender Foundation’s primary goal was to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community-based open source project. In July 2002, Ton managed to get the NaN investors to agree to a unique Blender Foundation plan to attempt to release Blender as open source. The “Free Blender” campaign sought to raise €100,000 so that the Foundation could buy the rights to the Blender source code and intellectual property rights from the NaN investors and subsequently release Blender to the open source community. With an enthusiastic group of volunteers, among them several ex-NaN employees, a fund raising campaign was launched to “Free Blender”. To everyone’s surprise and delight the campaign reached the €100,000 goal in only seven short weeks. On Sunday October 13, 2002, Blender was released to the world under the terms of the GNU GPL. Blender development continues to this day driven by a team of dedicated volunteers from around the world led by Blender’s original creator, Ton Roosendaal.

About Free Software and the GPL
===============================

When one hears about “free software”, the first thing that comes to mind might be “no cost”. While this is typically true, the term “free software” as used by the Free Software Foundation (originators of the GNU Project and creators of the GNU General Public License) is intended to mean “free as in freedom” rather than the “no cost” sense (which is usually referred to as “free as in free beer” or **gratis**). Free software in this sense is software which you are free to use, copy, modify, redistribute, with no limit. Contrast this with the licensing of most commercial software packages, where you are allowed to load the software on a single computer, are allowed to make no copies, and never see the source code. Free software allows incredible freedom to the end user. Since the source code is universally available, there are also many more chances for bugs to be caught and fixed.

When a program is licensed under the GNU General Public License (the GPL):

- You have the right to use the program for any purpose. 
- You have the right to modify the program, and have access to the source codes. 
- You have the right to copy and distribute the program. 
- You have the right to improve the program, and release your own versions. 

In return for these rights, you have some responsibilities if you distribute a GPL’d program, responsibilities that are designed to protect your freedoms and the freedoms of others:

- You must provide a copy of the GPL with the program, so that recipients are aware of their rights under the license. 
- You must include the source code or make the source code freely available. 
- If you modify the code and distribute the modified version, you must license your modifications available under the GPL (or a compatible license). 
- You may not restrict the licensing of the program beyond the terms of the GPL. (you may not turn a GPL’d program into a proprietary product.)
