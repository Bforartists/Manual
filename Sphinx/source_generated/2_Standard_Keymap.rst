*****************
2 Standard Keymap
*****************

.. contents:: Contents






The interaction concept for Bforartists is the graphical UI. And so the Bforartists keymap is as reduced as possible. It still contains most of the standard navigation hotkeys, and also standard hotkeys like for copy and paste, but nearly all hotkeys for tools are removed. So that users can implement their own hotkeys how they need it and when they need it.

The keymap that you can find in the Input Manager in the User Preferences is nevertheless still pretty heavy as you can see here. That's because the Input Manager in the user preferences contains all available user interaction. And not just the usual hotkeys to call tools like in other software. There is no distinction between tools and things like editor manipulation. Every user interaction is defined here. So be careful what you change at the here listed input nodes. You may remove a vital part to deal with windows for example.

The hotkeys are also editor specific. So there are lots of repetitions when you need the same hotkeys across several editors too. Navigation hotkeys for example.

Legend 

dbl- = Double tap. You need to press this key twice.

Note that some hotkeys are used in more than one menu. That's for example the case for hotkeys in the Node Editor section. They are true in three different editors, Shader editor, compositor, and texture node editor. To make it even worse, some exists in just one editor, and in a special mode.
