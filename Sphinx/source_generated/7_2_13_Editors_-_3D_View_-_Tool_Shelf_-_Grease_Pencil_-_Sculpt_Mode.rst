Smooth brush
------------

Smoothens the stroke under the brush.



Thickness
---------

Changes the thickness of the stroke under the brush.



Strength
--------

Adjust the transparency of the stroke under the brush. Note that the effect is pretty weak with even a strength of 1. You need several strokes until you get a visible effect.



Randomize
---------

Randomizes the curve points.



Grab
----

Grab the stroke and pull it around



Push
----

Push the stroke under the brush around.



Twist
-----

Twist the stroke under the mouse. Clockwise or counter clockwise.



Pinch
-----

Pinches or inflates the stroke under the mouse.



Clone
-----

Clones strokes. You first need to copy a stroke before you can clone it.

Currently you need to be in one of the mask selection modes for that. Then select a stroke. With circle select for example. Copy it with ctrl c. And then you should be able to clone the current stroke around with a mouse click.

Note that it clones the whole stroke, and not just the selected stroke geometry. The clone brush is more of a copy and paste stroke tool.
