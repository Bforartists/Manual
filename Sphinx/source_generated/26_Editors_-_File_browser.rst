File Browser
============

.. image:: graphics/26_Editors_-_File_browser/10000201000003FE000002781A77DD41EDA292D8.png

The file browser is a explorer dialog that allows you to browse for locations and files, and allows you to load and save them.

The file browser has multiple uses. While its often used for save/load, it can be kept open for other uses too.

In the file browser you can:

- Opening and Saving Blend files. 
- Import/Export other file formats. 
- Picking new locations for existing file-paths (images, videoâ€™s, fonts... etc). 
- Browsing inside other .blend files, when using **Append and Link**. 

You can also keep the file selector open, as with any other window type. In this case the buttons to load files is removed.The main purpose of this is to be able to drag media files.

- Images into the Video Sequence Editor (to set background or apply as material textures). 
- Media files into the Video Sequence Editor.

Recent
------

A list of the recent accessed folders.

Greyed out folders are not longer existing directories. There is unfortunately no way to remove them from within Bforartists. You would need to do this manually in the History text files in the settings folder.

Under Windows this is the bookmarks.txt file in the Appdata folder.

Load UI
